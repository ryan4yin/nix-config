# =============================================================
#
# Tailscale - your own private network(VPN) that uses WireGuard
#
# It's open souce and free for personal use,
# and it's really easy to setup and use.
# Tailscale has great client coverage for Linux, windows, Mac, android, and iOS.
# Tailscale is more mature and stable compared to other alternatives such as netbird/netmaker.
# Maybe I'll give netbird/netmaker a try when they are more mature, but for now, I'm sticking with Tailscale.
#
# How to use:
#  1. Create a Tailscale account at https://login.tailscale.com
#  2. Login via `tailscale login`
#  3. join into your Tailscale network via `tailscale up --advertise-routes 192.168.5.0/24`
#  4. If you prefer automatic connection to Tailscale, use the `authKeyFile` option` in the config below.
#
# Status Data:
#   `journalctl -u tailscaled` shows tailscaled's logs
#   logs indicate that tailscale store its data in /var/lib/tailscale
#   which is already persistent across reboots(via impermanence.nix)
