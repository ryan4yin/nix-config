      # As of Grafana 10, the Prometheus data source can be configured to query live dashboards 
      # incrementally, instead of re-querying the entire duration on each dashboard refresh.
      # Increasing the duration of the incrementalQueryOverlapWindow will increase the size of every incremental query, 
      # but might be helpful for instances that have inconsistent results for recent data.
      incrementalQueryOverlapWindow: 10m
